This post is part of the story of the decline of a game I really enjoyed. The story involves creative talent, corporate greed, obfuscation about the Jewish identity of a billionaire, and obscene microtransactions. If you’ve ever had the experience of buying a bag of chips from the grocery store and noting that even though the price is higher it seems that there’s a little more air and little less chips in the bag than there used to be, you have part of the story already. I won’t say much of anything here about the internal politics within *World of Warcraft* (although I do have opinions about that), as I prefer to talk about the collapse of the game itself. To set the stage, I want to mention a few aspects of the game that put some limitations on the design space the developers are working with.

One of the most defining aspects of World of Warcraft, both in terms of the culture surrounding it as well as its design as a game, is the division of its player base into two factions: “Horde” and “Alliance”. Many players, including me, have characters in both factions, but most players prefer one faction and identify with it.

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/DLWgVJ4/horde-alliance.jpg", "Horde and Alliance Logos" %}

The Alliance consists of fantasy races often considered “good guys”: humans, dwarves, elves, etc. They are run by a monarchy and have a traditional Western look-and-feel, except for the Pocohantas night elves. The Horde on the other hand has a much more “Duginist” feel to it, and consists of races such as orcs, trolls, and tauren (Amerindian cow-people). Inside the game world, these two factions are generally in a state of open warfare against each other (although there are many truces and local non-aggression zones).

The faction system has a few in-game consequences. Each faction appeals to different people, and it turns out that there are significantly more Horde players than [Alliance players](http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001366.php) (around 55% to 45%, although this fluctuates). And not only does the Horde faction have more players, they have better players. Horde players are younger and tend to be more achievement-driven and serious than Alliance players, who tend to be more casual gamers. This manifests itself in battlegrounds, a game mode in which groups of players from each faction go to battle with each other. The Horde side [wins](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/comments/mbrm1l/any_statistics_about_ah_bg_winloss_ratio/) more often.

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/QXtvmXn/arathi-basin-1.jpg", "The battleground Arathi Basin, seen from the starting location of the Horde team" %}

Additionally, group content is faction-specific. If you are playing an Alliance character and want to group up with other random characters to do a raid, you enter a queue and have to get matched with other Alliance characters. This means that whenever you're in a queue searching for other players you’re working with approximately half the player population, resulting in longer queue times than there would be otherwise.

The faction system has also limited the design of the game story over time. A major feature of the world is the war between Alliance and Horde, but neither side can really ever get a real advantage over the other. The war is in a permanent stalemate. When a new race joins the Alliance, a new race has to join the Horde. When a major Alliance city is destroyed, a major Horde city has to be destroyed. The geographic distribution of their cities and bases has to remain balanced. This is a major design constraint on the story.

Another design constraint is the pressure the game developers apparently feel to make each expansion more and more “epic”. This isn’t always the case, but the general trend over the years has been to constantly make the stakes higher and higher. In the first raid of the game, players defeated a fire monster who only wanted to burn the whole planet. Now, the entire galaxy or even the whole cosmos are at stake. The next raid will focus on defeating an antagonist called the Jailer, a rough equivalent of Satan, who wants to destroy all of existence or something for reasons that are both unclear and uncompelling. It’s a little ridiculous, and players have been [expressing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ou71cz/comment/h74p334/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a desire for things to come back down to earth a bit.

*World of Warcraft* first released in 2004 and was immensely popular immediately. I was an early adopter, my first character being a Tauren Druid. The world consisted of two continents, with 3 major cities in each. It felt vast. It took a while to travel from one place to another by road, especially with the expensiveness of mounts. Traveling across continents required waiting for a zeppelin (Horde) or ship (Alliance). It was a very different world from the Azeroth of today, where portals from faction capital cities to all other key locations make the technically bigger world seem much smaller - in much the same way that China feels a lot closer to us today than it would have during the age of sail.

In early 2007 Blizzard released an expansion, *World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade*. The expansion added two new races - a new type of elf for the Horde, and what are essentially [fauns](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei) for the Alliance - complete with new starting zones and new capital cities, as well as new late-game zones and raids. It was during this exciting time period that Blizzard first [announced](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/-i-world-of-warcraft-i-hits-10-million-subscribers) that *World of Warcraft* had reached 10 million subscribers.

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/r0xCj63/silvermoon-city-1.png", "Silvermoon City, one of my favorite places. The game provides no incentive to visit locations from older expansions, so it’s now a ghost town." %}

The game’s second expansion, *World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King*, released in [November of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King). A whole new continent, a frozen land to the north, and a new character class were introduced. This was a particularly special moment in the history of the game. *Wrath of the Lich King* is still almost universally recognized as the best *World of Warcraft* expansion to date, and I think it is probably one of the best products to ever come out of the computer gaming industry. The massive new continent had beautiful, towering fjords and ancient cultures with a nordic vibe. The visuals, the music, the design of the story and towns and settlements, and the dungeons and raids all hit a new level of polish. The game was becoming more approachable for casual players, but didn’t feel dumbed-down yet. It was during this expansion that *World of Warcraft* hit its peak popularity.

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/xFwGbWv/howling-fjord.png", "A view of the Howling Fjord, one of the landing zones from Wrath of the Lich King" %}

A few months before the release of *Wrath of Lich King*, Blizzard’s parent company merged with Activision to create [Activision Blizzard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Activision_Blizzard). That the best expansion in *World of Warcraft*’s history was initially developed prior to merger and that it has been (mostly) downhill ever since is usually not seen as a coincidence among the playerbase.

The CEO of Activision Blizzard, who was CEO of Activision at the time of the merge, is Bobby Kotick. If you try to do some research into his ethnicity or early life on his current [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Kotick), you won’t find anything interesting right now. However, his Jewish identity was a matter of some dispute among Wikipedia editors, with [revision comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Kotick&dir=prev&offset=20210926172449%7C1046630271&action=history) comprising a debate over time. Here are some tidbits in the argument between editors who are **for** and **against** referencing his Jewish identity on the page:

* **Against**: “unreliable and insufficiently reliable sources for a claim in a BLP that are at-best made tangentially to whether he says he is a Jewish (which he hasn't)”
* **For**: “Added link - you don't bat mitzvah your daughter unless you're Jewish”
* **Against**: “It might in fact be the girl's mother who is Jewish.”
* **For**: “If it is because of his sex scandal, it might because so many of the recent sex scandals in the headlines have been about Jews, i.e. Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, etc, and certain people don't want to add another name to the list. Just a guess.”
* **Against**: “This are inappropriate sources to identify *faith*”
* **For**: “In addition to his last name being very clearly Jewish, Bobby himself has commented on his ancestry numerous times. Jew is the ethnicity while Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people, something that some Wiki editors seem to be confused about.”
* **Against**: “Basing a *religion* around someone's last name is original research.”
* **For**: “Jewish is an ethnicity before it's a religion. I would think someone from Germany of all places would understand this. But I'll go ahead and add even more sources.”

As you can see, there are some editors trying to conceal the fact, and are maliciously pretending that the issue is about Bobby Kotick’s personal religious views. At any rate, that side won. There is currently no reference to his Jewish identity and the page is locked down. There is an [older version](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Kotick&diff=1055607355&oldid=prev#Personal_life) that references his Jewish identity under “Personal life”. Obfuscation aside, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a Jew. And also he used to date [Sheryl Sandberg](https://people.com/human-interest/sheryl-sandberg-bobby-kotick-split/).

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/R9VRcLF/sheryl-sandberg-and-bobby-kotick-1.jpg", "Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick" %}

After the Activision Blizzard merger, microtransactions increased in World of Warcraft. Since the launch of the game in 2004, there were always in-game items (pets, mounts, etc) that came with buying the collector’s edition of an expansion or attending the annual Blizzard convention (Blizzcon). Such bonus items didn’t create a toxic effect on the game. You might see a pet and know that somebody went to the recent Blizzcon. Otherwise, if you saw a cool pet, mount, or armor set, you know the player earned it through in-game accomplishments - and that it would be available to you too if you did those same accomplishments.

That really started to change in 2010. Blizzard added a mount called the [Celestial Steed](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Celestial_Steed) to the store for real money. It’s currently on sale and offered for $12 (down from $25). This received significant pushback from the playerbase, who were accustomed to paying a monthly subscription plus a flat one-time cost for each expansion. It was a greedy move from a game that already had a profitable model in place, and a sign of bad trends to come. This trend would continue, with each new year bringing more mounts and pets to the store.

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/kmcPDmQ/celestial-steed-wow-1.png", "A Celestial Steed. For only $25, this could be you. Plus a monthly subscription of $14.99 and $40 or more if an expansion comes out." %}

The expansion *World of Warcraft: Cataclysm* (2010) was the first major disappointment. In the previous expansion, players had defeated a long-standing enemy. In *Cataclysm*, the new antagonist was some giant dragon that there was little reason to care about. Some of the new territories were a pain to get around in. The new areas weren’t all together in a new continent, they were spread out in the existing world. Teleportation portals became the main method of transportation and players no longer had to think about geography much. The world felt much smaller. This is also when other measures were taken to make the game much more friendly to casual players. The basics of the game got much easier and it started to feel watered-down. All the while, store mounts continued. In 2014 this got [extra pushback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpYr20fregg), as the new store mounts during the *Warlords of Draenor* expansion were cooler than any legitimate in-game ones released at the same time.

In 2015, Blizzard introduced something called WOW tokens. This is something you can buy in the Blizzard store for real money and can redeem for subscription time. But instead of redeeming it, you can sell it in the in-game auction house for in-game gold. This is Blizzard’s way of letting you directly buy in-game money with real money. Players with lots of in-game gold will spend excess gold on WOW tokens for subscription time. Since experienced players will help walk less experienced players through content for a fee, this was also Blizzard’s way of underhandedly introducing a pay-to-win mechanic into *World of Warcraft* (more on this later).

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/QMXnJcM/wow-token-1.jpg", "Need to win? Give Activision Blizzard even more money!" %}

A pattern emerged regarding expansions and expansion quality. Blizzard has put out new expansions roughly every two years, and until recently every other expansion has been pretty good and the ones in between comparatively disappointing. The 2016 expansion, *World of Warcraft: Legion*, is widely viewed as the second-best expansion in the game’s history. 

The 2018 expansion *Battle for Azeroth* was one of the weaker ones (mostly due to the misfortune of being the expansion after *Legion*), but towards the end of its run it benefited from the advent of COVID and related lockdowns. Around this time, there was some attention given to CEO Bobby Kotick’s $800,000 salary. He also received a [bonus](https://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-bobby-activision-ceo-kotick-pockets-a-cool-dollar155-million/) of $155,000,000 (that’s 155 million), shortly after laying off hundreds of employees.

The current expansion, first released in November 2020, is *World of Warcraft: Shadowlands*. While it benefitted from releasing while many people were still under some lockdowns, its active player base tapered off pretty quickly. It is also notable for being the first exception to the pattern of every other expansion being really good. It just wasn’t that great of an expansion. Blizzard employees having to adjust to remote work over COVID probably hurt. The game released with even more than the normal amount of annoying busy-work quests and time-gating to stretch the shallow content over a longer time period. 

The popular *World of Warcraft* streamer Bellular did a [good job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToaLY0DF2gY) cutting through some of Blizzard’s smoke and mirrors to get a good picture of the current state of the game, which is extremely bleak. The basics are that the release of a new expansion during COVID brought a lot of people back, but they didn’t stay for long - probably due to the major problems with the game. Some work went into making good raids and other end-game content that only a minority of players partake in. But the main game world and storylines, while sometimes visually stunning, are lazily written and full of holes. Annoying mechanics and prerequisites turned more of the game into an unrewarding grind.

In 2009 a game called *FarmVille* launched on Facebook. It was mind-numbingly stupid and quite popular. It introduced some toxic mechanics to a broad user base. You had to do a bunch of tasks, then you would have run out of things to do. If you came back in 4 hours, you might be able to repeat some of those tasks. Yet more would be available in 6 hours. If you wanted to optimize your in-game rewards and grow your little farm, you had better have logged in frequently to check for new repetitive tasks to do. The wait times between activities can sometimes be a pain, and of course you can spend some real money to expedite a few things. These kinds of mechanics have crept into games all over the place ever since, including in *World of Warcraft*. In some cases it makes sense, such as when tending your personal herb garden in the *Warlords of Draenor* expansion. But when this kind of gameplay creeps into more aspects of the game, it ruins it. 

Activision Blizzard also owns the game *[Candy Crush Saga](https://www.king.com/game/candycrush)*. Its basic mechanic is from the older puzzle game Bejeweled (which was well explored by the great game PuzzleQuest), but it’s got a lot of bright, flashy colors and annoying FarmVille mechanics.

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/VTcMwNr/candy-crush-1.jpg", "Candy Crush Saga, the most obnoxious game I’m aware of. I see a future in which all games are exactly this." %}

One aspect of the *FarmVille* mechanic that has not been overtly implemented in *World of Warcraft* is the ability to pay real money to get ahead. There are plenty of ways to spend money on cosmetic items, something game companies have an easier time justifying. Any pay-to-win mechanic is an issue of “bad optics” for game companies that want to maintain the trust of their players. However, as mentioned earlier, the introduction of WOW tokens - which can be purchased for real money, sold in-game, and redeemed for game time - introduced a pay-to-win feature which is now very prevalent in the game.

The presence of these WOW Tokens directly supports a toxic trend known as “boosting”. Boosting is the practice by which a client pays in-game gold to mercenaries to carry them through group content. This practice, always present in virtual worlds, has exploded in *World of Warcraft* over the past few years. Bear in mind that the theoretically preferred way to engage with game content like raids and end-game dungeons is to group up with other players via the Group Finder feature, or by in-game chat, or with an in-game guild, or externally as part of a Discord group or something. The widespread practice of boosting means the game incentives that drive forming groups are fundamentally broken. If you try to join a group to experience a new raid via the Group Finder, you are compared against other applicants. If your gear level or character specification choices aren’t good enough, you have really no hope of finding a group - and as a result you have no way to experience the main content of the game you are paying for. 

Due to WOW Tokens, you have a way of paying real money for something you can easily convert to in-game gold. There are groups of experienced players who are willing to help carry less experienced players through tough end-game content - for a fee. They can use that gold to buy in-game items. They also have official ways to exchange that gold for more game time as well as less official ways to exchange the gold back to real money. This has toxic effects on the overall game. In-game achievements are completely cheapened as you never know if someone straight-up paid for one, and it’s even harder for normal players to find legitimate groups for content via the in-game Group Finder. All the while Blizzard makes money from the additional incentive for players seeking a boost to purchase WOW Tokens. The company does police real-money transactions, but it has little incentive to crack down on boosting if they only plan on cashing out on microtransactions until the game finally dies. Blizzard does have a record of making money by making good game content and selling it in the past, but it doesn’t seem like that’s the plan for *World of Warcraft*. And it turns out they have a lot of other stuff going on at the moment.

Starting in mid-2021, Activision Blizzard became the subject of a significant public scandal regarding a decade-long culture of sexual harassment and discrimination. This broke when the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a [suit](https://aboutblaw.com/YJw) against Activision Blizzard following a long investigation. My first instinct when I hear about sexual harassment scandals is to roll my eyes, but in this case it seems to have been persistently bad enough that I’m sympathetic to some of the core complaints. One of the major offenders was Alex Afrasiabi, a senior Creative Director for World of Warcraft. He had a culture around him that perhaps semi-ironically admired Bill Cosby. References to this game director got into the game world itself, most notably the Alliance NPC called [Field Marshal Afrasiabi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Field_Marshal_Afrasiabi). 

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/ZGsY04P/22cd3c99d68058b9247d17fda594b7ec-1.jpg", "You might be an American Nationalist if" %}

Another, funnier, aspect of the cultural scandal involves some metal music person named “Corpsegrinder”. In 2007, he gave an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW_Lv0r-l4c) and revealed that he was a major fan of *World of Warcraft*. During the interview he was keen to strongly clarify that he plays Horde, and called the Alliance “homo”.

No lie detected there. While there hasn’t been adequate research done into political affiliation by *World of Warcraft* faction, it is generally believed that the Alliance leans strongly conservative. A few weeks ago, I logged into an Alliance side character, and in the general chat of the Alliance capital of Stormwind I saw people talking about “let’s go Brandon”. Yea, I’d say the Alliance is pretty gay. At any rate, the Corpsegrinder video was played on stage during the BlizzCon convention in 2011, leading to a minor controversy and backlash about that.

Alex Afrasiabi was fired in 2020 for sexual harassment, and the NPC and other references to him were purged as part of a [general cleanup](https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-achievements-remove-references-to-hoe-1847629607) of politically incorrect content that took place over the summer and fall of 2021. A Horde character named after Corpsegrinder was also removed.

{% image "https://i.ibb.co/0DzPH7Z/field-marshal-afrasiabi-1.jpg", "Field Marshal Afrasiabi, now removed from the game" %}

In the midst of all the scandals, Activision Blizzard released a [statement](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-ceo-bobby-kotick-all-employees) declaring an intent to address the problems and improve. A major part of the strategy to do so involved partnering with a firm called [WilmerHale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmer_Cutler_Pickering_Hale_and_Dorr) to help them review policies and develop best practices. WilmerHale is an interesting choice, and is completely inconsistent with any goal of making the environment better for employees. It’s a major law firm based in DC, with corrupt ties to the Department of Justice. Even Bob Mueller was a former attorney in this firm. It has a background working with major employers, including Amazon, in helping fight [unionization efforts](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/jamie-gorelick-amazons-anti-union-shadow-adviser-at-the-doj/). The efforts include clandestine operations to sow mistrust, break solidarity, and spread anti-union talking points through the workforce as well as captive-audience seminars and other formal communications warning employees against unions. In fact, Blizzard just sent out such a [warning](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/10/1063230658/embattled-activision-blizzard-to-employees-consider-the-consequences-of-unionizi).

The CEO Bobby Kotick then took a voluntary [pay cut](https://kotaku.com/bobby-kotick-takes-another-pay-cut-waives-arbitration-1847953970), going from $875,000 to $62,000. He also initiated other [restorative measures](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-ceo-bobby-kotick-regarding-progress-and-commitments-made), including a plan to double the percentage of Activision Blizzard employees who are women or non-binary and other pro-diversity efforts. Besides being equivalent to a promise of making a worse game, the purpose of this goal is probably to help bust unions. Note that the Amazon-owned Whole Foods company is aware that [diversity helps reduce unionization risk](https://archive.fo/1khJw). It’s probable that the anti-union consulting firm considers diversification a key anti-worker strategy, and is recommending it to Blizzard in those terms.

As all this has been going on, many game commenters have been suggesting that the sexual harassment scandals are a major part of the WOW’s decline. But this is probably not true. Many major streamers who actually play (or played) the game don’t seem to think so. They pay lip service to Blizzard needing to do better and all that, but when they talk about *World of Warcraft*’s problems that rarely gets more than a passing mention.

The main issues pointed to by actual players are lazy game design and greedy practices that prioritize short-term profits over consistently making a good game. As the [Activision Blizzard 2021 Q2 Investor slides](https://investor.activision.com/static-files/7b75d6d0-5693-4adc-a599-e7c647d36c03) make clear, Blizzard has been focusing on getting their existing player base to make more gimmicky purchases via microtransactions rather than retain players or grow the playerbase. This has led to the growing theory that Blizzard is deliberately taking a “managed decline” strategy with *World of Warcraft*, sucking as much blood out of their players as they lead the game to a slow rather than make great expansions to the game to keep it alive for the longer term. Given how many people have been passionate about the game over the years, such a decision would be tragic but perhaps inevitable. The game’s player base is aging, it hasn’t approached the activity levels of *Wrath of the Lich King* (2008), and everything has to die eventually.

Blizzard is currently going on a hiring spree for creative types at the moment, so they may be planning to do something more than just bleeding the cash cow dry for another year or so. Bellular recently put out a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DaD1GOxQM) making his suggestions for turning the state of the game around. They are things Activision Blizzard could only do if they wanted to abandon the strategy of milking existing players for microtransactions. It’s unclear if that’s even in the cards. Despite the fact that a probably tiny minority of players are changing behavior based on the sexual harassment lawsuit, most of Blizzard’s communications are about their [firm resolution to become a gayer company](https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1420129038912278529/photo/1). These statements always contain language about “building trust”. But the main way they broke the trust of their actual players in the first place is by cheapening their most iconic and beloved game with aggressive microtransactions and *FarmVille* mechanics. They don’t have any language about fixing that.

One inconvenient fact is that the team with toxic “bro/frat culture” that allegedly dominated Blizzard for years is the the team that brought about the original game and the great expansion *Wrath of the Lich King*. A far more female and diverse team brought about the modern trash. Now, I don’t believe a culture of sexual harassment is a requirement for making a good game, but diversification has a real cost. It seems that one solution would have been to avoid signally diversification but try to curb some of the excesses of the alleged frat culture. There should’ve been a way to keep a good team while also providing a reasonably professional workspace. That way wasn’t taken.

The current business of video games is destroying games (and *World of Warcraft* isn’t the only example). My ideal solution would be to cut out the investors, grant long-standing players and employees ownership of the products who should elect a new CEO and be able to remove them. Decisions should be made by people accountable to those who have some reasons beyond quarterly profit to be invested in the outcomes. The idea that financial profit motive is sufficient to push out good product is partly false. There is an incentive to entice consumers with good quality, then to cheapen it and capitalize on it. And I think what happened to *World of Warcraft* proves this. This doesn’t have to be the way of doing things, but for the time being it is. I think it’s nearly over for WOW - and I think that’s an indicator of what’s going to happen to a lot more game franchises.
