In mid-2020, the New York Times Magazine released an
[interesting article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/magazine/colin-powell-iraq-war.html)
on Colin Powell.
It’s mostly a fluff piece, but it has some interesting tidbits.
Powell was the first Secretary of State during the Bush administration,
and his
[2003 speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3f_p_7OeE)
to the United Nations Security Council, in which he argued in favor of regime change in Iraq,
was a major part of the campaign to build public support for a U.S. invasion.
The image that Powell has been projecting,
both in the above article from last year and in other somewhat recent appearances and interviews,
is that he sort of knew better at first but was misled by administration officials and eventually went along with it.
It’s not convincing and it makes him look worse,
since the clear take-away from all of this is that he of all people should’ve
known better and was well-positioned to avoid the war.

Naturally, when looking back at the public case for the Iraq War, I was curious about the extent to which Israel was discussed, if at all. The general case against Iraq involved the likelihood that it had or was developing “weapons of mass destruction” (including biological weapons) that could be used against Americans if they got into the hands of Islamist terrorists. To argue for the likelihood of that, the Bush administration pointed to Saddam Hussein’s support for “radical” Palestinian groups. Otherwise, vague mentions of threats to “the region” were common. Bush sometimes included Israel in a list of vulnerable victims of potential Iraqi aggression alongside Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran (even after the latter was denounced as part of the “axis of evil”).

In Powell’s UN speech, Israel is mentioned twice – once by obvious reference and once by name- both in the latter half of the address. The first instance took place when Powell was making assertions about Iraq’s long-range missile aims. He showed the following map, depicting various missile ranges that Saddam Hussein was supposedly developing towards. Powell said, “you can see from this map, as well as I can, who will be in danger of these missiles.”

The only by-name mention of Israel in the speech comes a little later, when Colin Powell includes in his list of complaints about Iraq the accusation that Iraq was harboring and supporting Palestinian groups that conducted suicide attacks against Israel.

My personal memory of that time period is hazy. I was still in high school, and due to 9/11 I had decided to join the military once I was able to. I didn’t put a lot of thought into the purpose behind the Iraq War, even as it became clear that the US was going to invade and occupy Iraq and that I would soon be a participant.

The UN speech was the last of several major “pitches” the administration made for the invasion. The first was the [2002 State of the Union address](https://web.archive.org/web/20020201224625/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/01/print/20020129-11.html), largely written by the Jew David Frum. This was the first invocation of an “axis of evil”. After celebrating “victory” in Afghanistan, Bush denounced North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as the axis of evil, and then quickly moved on to talk about jobs and education. That was near the beginning of 2002, and I don’t remember if it was clear to most people that there was going to be a major war in Iraq. It wasn’t clear to me yet.

The next major pitch, and the event that made it clear to everyone that a war was coming, was when President Bush addressed the [United Nations General Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f45Ilb4JguY) in September of 2002 (one year after 9/11). He spent 30 minutes denouncing the Iraqi government before the whole world, aggressively tapping the podium during pauses as he spoke. The speech was followed by an aggressive media blitz (largely on Fox News) and a campaign of diplomatic pressure on the UN Security Council to approve a resolution supporting military force against Iraq. The US Congress quickly authorized military force against Iraq, if necessary, to enforce UN Security Council resolutions. Bush made several domestic comments about Iraq, and called on the UN to not be irrelevant. Military force wasn’t approved, but[Resolution 1441](https://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/documents/1441.pdf) was unanimously passed by the Security Council, including votes from Mexico, Singapore, Ireland, and Syria. The resolution found Iraq in violation of previous disarmament requirements levied by the UN after the Gulf War, established a more aggressive weapons inspection regime, and made several onerous demands of Iraq (including that UN inspectors have unfettered access to any location or official in Iraq at anytime without warning). Syria, the only Arab state on the Security Council at the time, made the following statement on its approval of the resolution:

<p class="fs-6 text-light">
Syria voted in favour of the resolution, having received reassurances from its sponsors, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and from France and Russia through high-level contacts, that it would not be used as a pretext for striking against Iraq and does not constitute a basis for any automatic strikes against Iraq. The resolution should not be interpreted, through certain paragraphs, as authorizing any State to use force.
</p>

<p class="text-center">-- Syria</p>

Despite Syria’s clarification, the upcoming war was becoming clear at that point and I remember thinking about it over Christmas break that year.

The next beat of the war drum was the [State of Union address for 2003](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-23). President Bush talked again about jobs and education, advocated for new tax cuts, and called for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. He then quickly denounced North Korea and Iran, before dwelling on Iraq at length. The same arguments he had been making were made again: that Saddam Hussein was a dangerous and sadistic madman who was delinquent on disarmament requirements, that intelligence pointed to Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction including biological weapons, that the Iraqi regime was pursuing nuclear weapons, that to trust the secular Baathists not to collaborate with Islamist terrorists was to take too risky a gamble. The obvious counterpoint that Baathists and Islamists have radically different aims was explained away by the assertion that they would readily unite against a common enemy: the United States and her freedoms.

It was shortly after this speech that the administration made its final pitch, sending Colin Powell to the United Nations in February 2003 with lies from the intelligence community about Iraq. Unlike Bush’s more aggressive speeches, Powell’s address was targeted for the skeptics who were on the fence about the wisdom of attacking Iraq, and made the case that the United States had done everything in her power to peacefully address the issues.

The next month, the invasion began.
